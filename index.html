			<h1>Chandler Muriel Bing</h1>
			<h2>
				Chandler Muriel Bing (born April 8, 1968) is a fictional character on the popular US television sitcom Friends (1994–2004), played by Matthew Perry. Chandler Muriel Bing, son of erotic novelist Nora Tyler Bing (Morgan Fairchild) and cross-dressing Vegas burlesque star Charles Bing (Kathleen Turner), was the roommate of Ross Geller in college. Throughout most of the series, Chandler was an executive specializing in statistical analysis and data reconfiguration. He later quit and found a job as a junior copywriter with an advertising agency. Chandler met Ross' sister, Monica Geller, and her friend Rachel Green while celebrating Thanksgiving at the Geller family residence. Chandler later moved to apartment #19 in New York City, across the hall from the apartment of Monica and her then roommate Phoebe Buffay. At the time, he shared the apartment with a Jewish man named Kip. Kip was a part of the group of friends until a short relationship with Monica caused tension. He got married and moved out - something which Chandler never really forgave him for. Chandler's next roommate, Joey Tribbiani, completed the group of friends. Chandler lived with Joey until season 6, when he moved in with Monica. He later married Monica at the end of season 7.

			<h1>Rachel Karen Green</h1>
			<h2>
				Rachel Karen Green (born February 8 or May 5, 1970) is a fictional character on the popular U.S. television sitcom Friends (1994-2004), played by Jennifer Aniston. Rachel appeared in the Pilot episode running into Central Perk in a rain-soaked wedding dress in search of her old friend Monica Geller, with whom she had had little contact since high school (except that she came to the Gellers' house for Thanksgiving during their freshman year of college as seen in a flashback scene). Rachel, unlike Monica, was popular during high school, and had always been promiscuous, which is steadily reflected in a comical sort of way throughout the series until the last couple of seasons. Rachel had fled her wedding to Barry Farber (or Barry Finkle, as has also been mentioned) having discovered she desired the gravy boat that she had been given as a wedding gift more than she desired Barry, Rachel was stuck in a state of arrested development, an adult woman who emotionally had not outgrown adolescence.

			<h1>Monica E. Geller</h1>
			<h2>
				Monica E. Geller (born April 22, 1969) is a fictional character on the popular US television sitcom Friends (1994-2004), played by Courteney Cox Arquette. Monica is the younger sister of Ross Geller. It was revealed over the course of the series that she was an extremely overweight child and weighed up to 255 pounds before losing weight sometime during her freshman year of college after hearing Chandler call her fat. Monica was shown in her earlier "fat" stage in flashback scenes in a few episodes, with Courteney Cox wearing a fat suit. She met Ross' friend Chandler Bing (who suggested that she should become a chef) when he and Ross were in college; Monica and Chandler got together in London during the season 4 finale. They were married in Season 7. Monica shared her apartment with Phoebe Buffay, who moved out before the series actually began, fearing their relationship would be strained when Monica's neatness became a burden. Monica's new roommate was her friend from Lincoln High School, Rachel Green; in the pilot episode, Rachel left her fiancé Barry Farber at the altar and moved in with Monica. Monica met Joey Tribbiani when he became the new roommate of Chandler, who lived across the hall from Monica.

			<h1>Joseph Francis Tribbiani, Jr</h1>
			<h2>
				Joseph "Joey" Francis Tribbiani, Jr. (born January 9, 1968) is a fictional character on the popular US television sitcom Friends (1994–2004), and the title character in the spin-off, Joey (2004-2006), and is played by Matt LeBlanc. Joey comes from an Italian American family of 8 children, of which he is the only male. He is one of the few "Friends" that made (relatively) few moves of home, having only changed apartments four times in the series: once, when he and Chandler moved into what is usually Monica's apartment after winning it from her in a game in "The One with the Embryos" and then moved back with Chandler into his own apartment; another time, he moved to his own lavish apartment away from Chandler, with whom the psychotic Eddie moved in, but shortly moved back afterwards. Joey is a "stereotypical" actor: oversexed, under-educated and constantly looking for work. He was ordained a minister in The One with Chandler And Monica's Wedding.

			<h1>Phoebe Buffay</h1>
			<h2>Phoebe Buffay (later Buffay-Hannigan) (born February 16, 1967) is a fictional character on the popular US television sitcom Friends (1994-2004), played by Lisa Kudrow. She is well known for a number of reasons, including her guitar playing in Central Perk, and elaborate improbable stories about her previous life. Phoebe appears to be the most "promiscuous" of the three girls, being the one most often referred to as having casual sex. It was hinted at several times during the show that Phoebe enjoyed 'kinky' sex, involving, for example, handcuffs. At one point, she suggests Mike's absence was due to her having handcuffed him to a drainpipe. She also alludes to having had sex in an elevator and in a public restroom. In a later episode, she is apparently trying to convince Mike to do something very weird and/or kinky, and whispers her wish to Joey, he is clearly disturbed and leaves, yelling "I'm not helping you do that!". During the episode The One with Rachel's Phone Number, Rachel attempts to convince Mike to do her a favor by promising that Phoebe will do anything he wants: "Seriously, I'm talking dirty stuff." Mike is surprised that it could "get any dirtier". In an episode where she wants to know more about a man and sends Joey to ask him questions, she is disappointed to learn that he "isn't into weird stuff - sexually". In Season 3 Episode 11 (The One Where Chandler Can't Remember Which Sister), she is sent to yell at the noisy man that lives upstairs from Rachel and Monica, but starts dating him, and Monica and Rachel hear sexual noises through the ceiling a couple of days later.

			<h1>Ross Eustace Geller</h1>
			<h2>Ross Eustace Geller, Ph.D., (born October 18, 1967) is a fictional character on the popular US television sitcom Friends (1994–2004), played by David Schwimmer. Ross is the older brother of Monica Geller, and was often favored by their parents (particularly their mother) over her. His birthday is on October 18 (although in another episode he claims it's in December). When he was born, he was described as a "medical marvel", since his mother was originally believed to be barren. The two siblings are extremely competitive as was demonstrated in 'The One With the Football', where it emerged that every Thanksgiving during their childhood they had taken part in a football match called 'The Geller Bowl'. This continued until one year (Geller Bowl 6) Monica broke Ross' nose, and their parents forbade them from ever playing football again. In their childhood, Monica and Ross were very violent with each other. For example, Monica apparently hit Ross with a giant pumpkin. For his part, Ross once jammed a stick through the spokes of Monica's bike causing her to flip over and hit her head on the curb and jamming a pencil in her hand.</h2>
